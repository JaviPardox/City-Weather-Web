# Web Design Challenge

The goal of this project is to create an simple but attractive HTML/CSS interface with the results of data gathered from the Open Weather API. 
The code consists of 7 HTML files.
The styling is done through Bootswath's Litera theme plus some customization from my part.

----------------

The general layout consists of:
- A navigation bar to move around the website.
- A left side container used to display information.
- A right side container used to display the graphs for easy accesibility.

The navigation bar consists of:
- Website title that reffers to the landing page.
- Two menu options, Comparison and Data. 
- A dropdown menu with each graph title.
